# PacMen Exercise

## Description
This project was created for the Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN MITxPRO course. This project was created to showcase our ability to use arrays and manipulate the DOM. On click, a PacMan will appear and begin to move at a random pace. 

## How to Run
Download the files from my repository, open the folder in your documents/finder, then open the html file to view.

## Road Map
Future updates and improvements to this application include creating a more realisitc game. Whether that being new images of the PacMen or simulating the PacMen chasing a smaller ball.
